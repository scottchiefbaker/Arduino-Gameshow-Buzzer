# Arduino Gameshow Buzzer

Simple gameshow style buzzer system for Arduino

## Specifications

Gameshow buzzer system that features RGB LED control for buzzins. Each
team is assigned a color, and when they buzzin the LEDs are set to that color,
and then locked-out for a short time. This prevents multiple buzzins from
different teams stomping on each other.

## Application

We needed a simple system to use for a Jeopardy style gameshow we were putting
on. This is the physical component that controls the buzzin system, the display
is separate.
